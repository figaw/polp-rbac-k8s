# Minikube Examples

## Prerequisites

Install Minikube from: <https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>.

You can probably run the examples in other distributions of Kubernetes,
I simply chose minikube because it felt more self-contained for demo purposes,
and it was very easy to get started with.

## Interacting with Minikube

```
minikube start
minikube stop
```
