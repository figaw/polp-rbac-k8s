## Slides

Found in the file `Practical Impl of PoLP with RBAC and Threat Modeling in K8s.pdf`

## Contributing

Please don't (other than, if you find something that's literally broken,
or a typo.) This repository is just intended to serve as the companion
repository for a live presentation, and some get-started with RBAC examples :)

## Contact

If you have issues with an example or want to talk Kubernetes,
you should be able to find me `@figaw` on Twitter.
If my DMs are open, I'm happy to chat! ðŸŽ‰
